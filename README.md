# Horiseon Refactor

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

-What was your motivation?

My motivation throughout doing this homework is me trying to learn code and get a job as a software engineer. Im really young, probably the youngest in the class. I'm 18 and ive always known I want to do something in business and I know learning how to code is going to give me a lot of opportunties afterwards. My plan is to find a job after the bootcamp and then I could eventually start my online businesses with the knowledge I carry from working in the industry and the knowlege this bootcamp is going to provide for me, to then take that with me to start my own business or company. Achieving that is what kept me motivated to finishing this assignment. 


- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") 

I refactored the code, deleted double coding, made it more organized, changed all the divs to semantic elements and accordingly changed the css. I also made sure all the links were working. I did this for better accessibility. 

- What problem does it solve?

All the links work. It's more organized.
- What did you learn?

Git add, commit, and push has been getting way easier and after doing this project I feel like the git add, commit, and push has stuck in my head and I'm comfortable navigating through folders within my terminal. For the most part I understand the things I do when I do them. Like now I know what the purpose of git adding, commiting a message, and pushing to github and why its so neccessary to push to github.

Then you could go to your terminal and cd your way onto the repo you made with the code pasted into it and code . and change the code on there.
